# New-York-Homeless-Shelter-Data-Analysis-

The New York City Homeless Shelter Data Analysis project focuses on understanding a complex yet crucial question: How many people spend each night in NYC homeless shelters? Through the analysis of over 3,000 records from the Department of Homeless Services (DHS), this project aims to provide insights that will aid in improving decision-making and resource allocation in the cityâ€™s shelter system.

**Data Analysis:**

-The project involves using the powerful Pandas library to explore and analyze the dataset. Through various statistical techniques, key trends and insights are uncovered, such as daily shelter occupancy, demographic breakdowns, and usage patterns across different seasons.

-The analysis focuses on extracting useful metrics and identifying significant trends to better understand how shelter usage changes over time and under different circumstances.

**Data Visualization:**

-To make the insights easily understandable, Matplotlib is used to create clear and intuitive visualizations. These visualizations, such as line graphs, bar charts, and histograms, allow stakeholders to quickly grasp the critical data points and trends.

-The visualizations focus on presenting occupancy trends, comparisons between family and individual shelter use, and identifying peak times for shelter demand.
